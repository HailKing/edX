                            This was the first book I read at the age of 12/13 years old. At that time 
                            I had already known the character of Sherlock from common sense, as a synonym
                            for a clever person but never really had contact with. So when I read I couldn't 
                            stop until then end when I found out the killer was right behind my nose. The way
                            crime is pictured is wonderful, if we may say such thing about such horror, and
                            the tools mr.Holmes uses to discover everything is something really out the curve
                            when goes to intelligence. So this is a book I would strongly recommend everyone 
                            to read.

                            I have already read the first 2 books of the serie "A song of Ice and Fire" 
                            and although not very familiar with the fantasy writting style I have enjoyed
                            a lot so far a lot. G.R.R Martin is really good writer and the way he can make
                            every character human and failiable is fantastic as well as his concern about 
                            making us see how every character evolves throughout the serie.

                            This was the second book I read after reading the Study in Scarlet 
                            and although it's a child book I still like it so much, because of 
                            the writing style that makes me feel in a videogame every time Percy faces
                            a monster and in addition to that it still teaches Greek mythology which
                            I like very much. The idea of making story about demigods is not new 
                            but the way RIck Riodan adapts the story certainly is, so it is very worthy
                            of your time to read and find out how the story goes on.
