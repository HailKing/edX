                            This is for certain one of the best TV shows ever made. The tale of a 
                            chemistry who starts a drug business to get money for his family is
                            so well build that catches us, and as story gradually starts to grow I got 
                            myself thinking what would be the next trouble that Walter, the protagonist,
                            will face and how he is going to solve. Furthermore the psychology of the 
                            characters is very well worked in this serie and that is the biggest golden 
                            key of it, because we can see how they sufer because of the troubles they go 
                            through and how they get affected by them

                            As one of my favorite books, the tales of Sherlock Holmes are one
                            of my favorite TV shows, but on the contrary of the books the series
                            goes to the London of 2nd millenium, here Sherlock is consultor detective,
                            a profession that he created for himself. The shows is well written
                            and makes the readers feel happy as the serie readapts the written novels
                            and shows us how maybe the story could have been written if the author lived
                            in our time.

                            This is one of my first TV shows. Here we keep up with Ragnar
                            Lothbrook, a farmer viking, but also a warrior that had a vision
                            forward and sail west to conquer new lands. As the story goes along
                            we see how smart Ragnar is and we learn the vikigs costumes and 
                            tradition. It is very good show and the character of Ragnar is particularly
                            well built, thanks to the direction and to the actor Travis Fimme.
